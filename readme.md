# Chatronix AI Chatbot Project

## Introduction

This project is a Chatbot application built using PHP. It's designed to interact with users by sending and receiving messages through the OpenAI API. This project served as a great learning experience, enhancing my understanding of PHP, API integration, and security best practices.

## Features

- Interacts with users in real-time.
- Uses OpenAI's API to generate conversational responses.
- Implements secure handling of sensitive API keys.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: Server-side scripting language used for handling requests and responses.
- OpenAI API: Provides an AI-powered conversational interface.
- HTML/CSS: Structures and styles the chatbot's frontend interface.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've expanded my knowledge and skills in several areas:

- **PHP**: Gained a deeper understanding of how to handle HTTP requests and responses in PHP.
- **API Integration**: Learned how to securely integrate and interact with third-party APIs using PHP.
- **Security**: Enhanced my understanding of security best practices, particularly around the secure handling and storage of API keys.

## Setup and Deployment

### Requirements

- A server with PHP support.
- Composer for managing PHP dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your server's web directory.
2. Run `composer install` to install the required PHP dependencies.
3. Configure the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

### Running the Application

Access the project through your web server's domain or IP, and interact with the chatbot via the provided interface.

## Security Notes

- The `.env` file is set with `600` permissions, ensuring that it's only readable by the script and not exposed to the public.
- Additional server configurations, such as denying access to `.env` files through `.htaccess`, are implemented for enhanced security.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional features such as user authentication and session management.
- Expand the bot's capabilities by integrating more APIs.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to all the resources and communities that provided guidance and support throughout this learning journey.
